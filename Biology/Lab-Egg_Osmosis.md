# Egg Osmosis

## Purpose
Determine how the concentration of the solution affects Osmosis.

## Hypothesis
In the Vinegar, it will take in the vinegar

## Safety Concerns

+ Do not eat the egg
+ Clean up area after the Lab
+ Clean egg after taken out of solution

## Materials
+ Raw Egg
+ Vinegar
+ Corn Syrup
+ 2 Cups (1 Normal, 1 Small)
+ Water

## Procedures

- Weigh the Raw Egg and record the weight in the table.
- Place the egg in the cup and pour vinegar over the egg.
- Record your observations of the egg and the vinegar in your lab notebook.
- Fill the smaller cup with water and place it on the top of the egg.
- Write your group names on the outside of the cup.
- Answer the Day 1 Questions in the discussion section.
- Remove the egg from the cup and dry it off with a paper towel. 
- Carefully remove any pieces of shell that may be attached to the egg. (If the shell is still really attached, just leave it alone).
- Weigh the egg and record the weight in the table.
- Pour out the vinegar from the cup. 
- Fill the cup with either corn syrup or water. 
- Answer the Day 2 Questions in the discussion section.
- Remove the egg from the cup and dry it off.
- Weigh the egg and record the weight in the table.
- Empty the cups and clean up your lab area.
- Answer the rest of the discussion questions.

## Observations

| Original Weight | Weight after Vinegar | Weight after Corn Syrup |
|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 62.2g           | 91.5g                | 53.6g                   |

## Conclusions
+ Right after putting the egg in the Vinegar the shell was slowly disappearing.
+ After the egg was put in the corn syrup, it became shriveled up, and the shell was gone.
+ The hypothesis was supported. After the egg was put in the solutions, it took in the vinegar and corn syrup.
