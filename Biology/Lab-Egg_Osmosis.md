# Egg Osmosis

## Purpose
Determine how the concentration of the solution affects Osmosis.

## Hypothesis
In the Vinegar, it will take in the vinegar

## Safety Concerns

+ Do not eat the egg
+ Clean up area after the Lab
+ Clean egg after taken out of solution

## Materials
+ Raw Egg
+ Vinegar
+ Corn Syrup
+ 2 Cups (1 Normal, 1 Small)
+ Water

## Procedures

1. Weigh the Raw Egg and record the weight in the table.
2. Place the egg in the cup and pour vinegar over the egg.
3. Record your observations of the egg and the vinegar in your lab notebook.
4. Fill the smaller cup with water and place it on the top of the egg.
5. Write your group names on the outside of the cup.
6. Answer the Day 1 Questions in the discussion section.
7. Remove the egg from the cup and dry it off with a paper towel. 
8. Carefully remove any pieces of shell that may be attached to the egg. (If the shell is still really attached, just leave it alone).
9. Weigh the egg and record the weight in the table.
10. Pour out the vinegar from the cup. 
11. Fill the cup with either corn syrup or water. 
12. Answer the Day 2 Questions in the discussion section.
13. Remove the egg from the cup and dry it off.
14. Weigh the egg and record the weight in the table.
15. Empty the cups and clean up your lab area.
16. Answer the rest of the discussion questions.

## Observations

| Original Weight | Weight after Vinegar | Weight after Corn Syrup |
|:---------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 62.2g           | 91.5g                | 53.6g                   |

## Conclusions
+ Right after putting the egg in the Vinegar the shell was slowly disappearing.
+ After the egg was put in the corn syrup, it became shriveled up, and the shell was gone.
+ The hypothesis was supported. After the egg was put in the solutions, it took in the vinegar and corn syrup.
