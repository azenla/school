# Organic Molecule Lab

## Purpose
Indirectly measure the energy content of various foods by burning and measuring the heat absorbing by a known volume of water.

## Hypothesis
Cheetos will burn the best.

## Safety Concerns
+ Keep hair out of fire
+ Clean up area
+ Wear Goggles

## Materials
+ Aluminum pie pan
+ Safety lighter
+ CBL with temperature probe
+ Water
+ Dissection (teasing) needle
+ 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask
+ Balance
+ Calculator
+ Various foods to test

## Procedures
1. Get equal amounts of food (About 3g)
2. Fill Graduated Cylinder with 50 mL of water. Pour water into flask.
3. Assign somebody to hold needle, burn food, and measure temperature
4. Put thermometer into flask. Record initial temperature.
5. Once it is setup, swirl the flask with the thermometer in it while holding it above the flame. Light food on fire above pan, and wait for it to burn out.
6. Constantly monitor the temperature and make sure to remember the maximum temperature.
7. Once the food has burned, get remains and weigh.
8. Record values on the table.
9. Rinse out flask and fill it again.
10. Repeat steps above for the 3 foods.
11. After you are done, cleand and dry flask, pan, and needle. Dry off thermometer. Fill in the "Actual Results" column in your chart on the first page.
